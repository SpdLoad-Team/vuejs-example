# SpdLoad Vue.js Example

In this gist we want to show our implementation of a fairly typical dashboard.

This was implemented with **vue3** **tailwindcss** and **inertiaJs**.

We implement our projects using modern programming approaches and modern technologies.

In this small gists you can see our approach to building components, using mixins and other features of **vue3** and compositing **api**.

The dashboard features a filter and multi language and a timeline with a time slot switch and cards output.
